## About
This is my graduation project: **VFX Fractal Toolkit** (VFT), which I developed at *Filmakademie Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg* while studying [Technical Directing](https://animationsinstitut.de/de/studium/animation/technical-director/informationen/).

It contains tools written in *OpenCL, OSL, Blink, Python, VEX and JavaScript* intended to be used in *Houdini, Arnold, Nuke or a web browser*.

The code is in prototyping stage and many features are experimental. It is not production ready and some parts need refactoring.

Here are some animations produced with it:

* [![2D fractals](img/2d.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__8gaEv5GAs)

I had a chance to present progress of VFT at two **FMX** conferences (2018, 2019), you can find the recordings here:

This project was presented at **The 15th ACM SIGGRAPH European Conference on Visual Media Production** [(CVMP 2018)](https://www.cvmp-conference.org/2018/programme/) conference: [fast-forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CI8GFDmKZQ), [paper](https://animationsinstitut.de/fileadmin/user_upload/files_forschung/pdf/Publications/18_cvmp_vft_juraj_tomori_paper.pdf), [poster](https://animationsinstitut.de/fileadmin/user_upload/files_forschung/pdf/Publications/18_cvmp_vft_juraj_tomori_poster.png).
